## **What Changed:**

### **✅ Removed:**
1. **SQLite JobPartNumber table** - No longer needed
2. **SaveJobToDatabase method** - Eliminated duplicate storage
3. **Database job history** - Excel is now the history
4. **Dual save operations** - Single Excel update only

### **✅ Updated:**
1. **Save Job** → Only updates Excel spreadsheet
2. **Burn List** → Reads job/XML relationships from Excel
3. **All Methods** → Use Excel as data source for job assignments

## **Current Workflow:**

### **Engineering Process:**
1. **Load Excel** → Import MRP data from spreadsheet
2. **Generate Cutlist** → Show parts needed with XML files
3. **Save Job** → **Updates Excel with XML assignments** 📊
   - Message: *"Excel updated with job assignments!"*

### **Manufacturing Process:**
4. **Create Burn List** → Reads XML assignments from Excel
   - Generates equipment files (.erp/.wol) for cutting machines
   - Uses Excel as source of truth for job/XML relationships
